I liked this one, but I found it a bit too difficult. I haven't been able to beat the game. You have to balance two things at once; the pond's health and the frog's health. You don't win when the pond reaches perfect health, you have to just stay alive while keeping the pond alive. If you eat too many flies, the frog dies; if you let flies go, the pond dies. The only way to regain health is to eat fairies but there aren't enough fairies to keep up the frog's health. Also I found the frog's health bar difficult to see. I think it's a bit too small to see. But I did like it, I really liked how the frog looks. I love the concept conceptually it was just a bit too hard for me.

I liked this one as well, but I found it a bit strange that the tounge does not come out of the frog's mouth. I found the bit where when the frog eats the yellow flies it just turns yellow a tad bland. I thought the fly would be worh more points or something, but all it does is turn the frog yellow. But I loved the flies. I love their wings and their up and down motion. I found the background very pretty.

I found this one kind of chaotic and difficult to understand. I think it needed a screen to explain what is happening. I had to play it a few times to understand what the number in the upper left corner even was. It like a countdown that you can add to by catching flies, and when you reach at least 10, the sky turns orange and blue circles appear. I didn't really understand what those were until I read the READ.ME.
