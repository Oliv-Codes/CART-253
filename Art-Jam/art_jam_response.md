I love Ash’s Art Jam. It’s very aesthetically pleasing and it’s very interactive. I love that it gives a prompt on what to do. I like that in their README it has examples of drawings that have been done in their Art Jam. I found the direction they went in surprising since the assignment was to make a self portrait and they made a cat creature. I love the boldness in direction.

I love Xueyi’s Art Jam. It’s very cute. I like moving the mouth. I’m impressed she got that triangle in the center. I’ve never been able to get the triangle to cooperate.

I like Yann’s Art Jam. It think it might be the most life like portrait I saw in class. It’s very impressive. I like the idea of showing himself aging. It looks a bit like a school year book the way it’s laid out.
