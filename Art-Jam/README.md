## Description

> This is a simple self protrait.

> I used a bezier for the first time. I used it for some eyes. It was very finicky to use, but I got it to work.

> You may click to make me blink! This is my conditional.

> You may use the mouse to give me a clown nose. This is my use of mouseX and mouseY

> Background turns to black as a new backdrop appears. This is my variable.
