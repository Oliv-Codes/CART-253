#Mod Jam Ideas

1-have levels (have progression and completion)
2-a fullness meter, once full you pass to next level (to have a goal)
3-maybe the frog is allergic to fireflies so when it catches one,you lose a life or point (change the color of the flies to yellow or red)
4-new levels with diffrent bugs worth more points (like a butterfly)
5-has to hide from predators (mayby a weasle could be trying to eat the frog. it could be hiding out of canvas)
6-day night cycle with fireflies at night (nightmode would be like hard mode)
7-frog gets fatter every level (not sure to have frog get bigger after every fly eaten or after levels)
8-there's a second rival frog that eats your flies (would need "frog AI")
9-if frog eats the magic star, frog turns into prince
10-at night, frog turns into werewolf frog (I could just makefrog grey and add some ears)
11-multiple endings (good end=frog is full, bad end=frog dies of allergic reaction or starvation, secret ending=frog becomes prince)
12-frog eats a mutant bug which gives him a second toungue (must add a max amount of mutant flies to limit the amount of tongue)
13-hot weather makes tongue shorter(because thristy)
14-cold weather makes frog slower (because frog is freezing)
15-frog can leap into lily pads to get closer to flies(frog would have to get closer if tongue is shorter)
16-frog makes sound effects (just a bit of flavour)
17-powerup fly that makes flies worth double and makes frog immune to dangers (kinda like the star in Mario. I think this would need 2 functions. one for point doubling and one for imunity to fireflies)
18-ability to shoot bubbles at fireflies (defensive power up idea. I don't know how to activate it since we are already clicking with mouse to make tongue. Maybe with keyboard?)
19-ability to fly (maybe frog grows wings after eating a power up)
20-victory emote (maybe he can jump around or wiggle when full)
21-maybe. princess blows a kiss at frog to catch to become prince (have princess beyond the canvas, have her slide into frame to blow kiss before sliding back)
